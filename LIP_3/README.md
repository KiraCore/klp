# 5. Example Deployment and expected output

## Deploy to Local Testnet

```
npm run build & npm run deploy:development
```

## Deploy to Kovan testnet

Make sure the private key has enough test ether on the Kovan test network to fund the deployment transactions.

```
$ npm run build & npm run deploy:kovan
```

## Verification

In order to verify your smart contract on etherscan.io execute the verification script immediately after the contract is successfully deployed and pass the contract name as the argument.

```
$ npm run verify:kovan KiraAuction
```

# 6. Instructions for interacting with the contract

> You can copy generated ABI as follows so that you can interact with the contract:

```
cd $HOME/liquidity-program/$LIP_ID
jq -r ".abi" ./build/contracts/KiraAuction.json > ./build/ABI.json
cat ./build/ABI.json | xclip -selection c
```

> Interact with the contract

* Send 200 KEX tokens to the Auction contract
  ![Transfer_200_KEX_To_Auction_Contract](doc/1.png)

  ![Config_Auction](doc/4.png)
    * Wait until the auction starts
    * Wait 10 seconds and send 0.8 ether to the contract from `User 1`
    * Wait 60 seconds and send 0.6 ether to the contract from `User 2`
    * Wait 30 seconds and check `isFinished`
  ![IsFinished](doc/isFinished.png)
* Whitelist Token Transfer (allow unconditional transfer for the contract)
  ![AllowUnconditionalTransfer](doc/allow_unconditional_transfer.png)
* Claim KEX from `User 1` and get ~114.28 KEX
* Claim KEX from `User 2` and get ~85.71 KEX
* Withdraw Funds and get `1.4` ether
